## Collaborative Workflow & Quality Assurance

To ensure a smooth development process, maintain code quality, and foster effective collaboration within our team of 12, we've implemented the following key practices:

### ✅ 1. Designated Code Ownership

To streamline code reviews and ensure accountability, we've established a clear code ownership policy.

*   **How it Works**: We've added a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file to our project.
    ```
    * @kachi-jasperD
    ```
*   **Impact**: This configuration automatically assigns `@kachi-jasperD` as the designated reviewer for all pull requests.

---

### ✅ 2. Robust Main Branch Protection

The `main` branch is the heart of our project. We've configured comprehensive branch protection rules to safeguard its integrity:

*   **Goal:** Prevent direct commits to `main` and enforce PR-based workflows.
*   **Key Protections:**
    - Require pull requests before merging
    - Require at least 1 approving review
    - Require review from Code Owners
    - Require status checks to pass before merging
    - Require branches to be up-to-date before merging

*   **Outcome:** This setup minimizes risks of introducing bugs, conflicts, or accidental overwrites, maintaining a stable codebase.

✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings.**
